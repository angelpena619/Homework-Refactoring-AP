# Refactoring Homework

was given this existing html to refactor this code, The goal for this project was to make this website more accessible, and improve its overall function. 


## what was done on my part

the code needed much work it looked like it was missing a title, and also seemed to have many redundancies in the css selectors, 

I tried to consolidate as many of the selectors that I could. made sure the proper headings were used, and also added alt names for the images. which it did not have. 

title was missing, along with sectioning off the divisions with an appropriate tag. 


## what I was unable to accomplish

I noticed that this website had way too many div tags involved with the code, I deleted what I could without breaking the website.Â
